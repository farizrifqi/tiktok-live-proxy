# Tiktok Live Proxy

This is a Cloudflare Worker designed to proxy TikTok Live stream segments. It is part of the [Tiktok Live Monitoring](https://github.com/farizrifqi/tiktok-live-monitoring-webui) project, which provides tools for interacting with TikTok Live streams.

## Features

- **Proxy TikTok Live Streams**: Proxies TikTok Live stream segments to bypass regional restrictions.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Built as a Cloudflare Worker for fast and efficient proxying.
- **Supports M3U8 Playlists**: Handles `.m3u8` playlists and individual segments.

## Usage

### Endpoint

- **Proxy Stream**:
  ```
  GET /proxy-stream/:encodedUrl/:segment
  ```
  - `:encodedUrl`: Base64-encoded and reversed URL of the TikTok Live stream.
  - `:segment`: (Optional) The specific segment to fetch (e.g., `index.m3u8` or `segment.ts`).

### Example

1. Encode the TikTok Live stream URL using Base64 and reverse it:

   ```javascript
   const encodedUrl = Buffer.from('https://example.com/stream/index.m3u8').toString('base64');
   const reversedUrl = encodedUrl.split('').reverse().join('');
   ```

2. Fetch the stream or segment:
   ```
   GET /proxy-stream/<reversedUrl>/index.m3u8
   ```

## Installation
